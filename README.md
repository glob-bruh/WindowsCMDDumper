## Purpose:
The purpose of this script is to take system and user information (such as a list of all files and the entire registry) and pack it into a single .zip file. The script only uses built-in tools already present on Windows 10 to accomplish this. 

## Usage:
1) Download the .bat file.
2) Right-click the .bat file and click "Run as administrator".
3) Click "yes" on the User Account Control window.
