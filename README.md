# Windows CMD Dumper

## Purpose:

The purpose of this script is to take system and user information (such as a list of all files and the entire registry) and pack it into a single zip file. The script only uses built-in tools already present on Windows 10 to accomplish this. 

## Usage:

1) Download the .bat file.
2) Right-click the .bat file and click "Run as administrator".
3) Click "yes" on the User Account Control window. 
4) Wait until the Command Prompt window closes.

The zip file can be found either on the desktop directly or by navigating to the desktop folder in a program like File Explorer.
